    <p>My name is Eddie Freier. Growing up, I played soccer, basketball and golf. I realized I had a passion for sports, and have always been driven to find a career where I could continue to participate in at least one of these in some way.</p>

    <p>I continued that dream at Luther College, where I was a student coach for 4 years. I graduated from Luther College in 2016, with a bachelors degree in Accounting. I worked at Baker Tilly as an auditor, primarily working with Non-Profit Organizations and Higher Education clients for 2 years before deciding I wanted a career change.</p>
